# ✈️ Flight Price Prediction  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to predict airline ticket prices based on various factors like days left for departure, airline type, and other features. The goal is to help travelers get insights into price trends and make informed booking decisions.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- Python 🐍  
- Scikit-learn 🤖  
- Pandas & NumPy 📊  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn 📉  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset used for training was sourced offline and preprocessed to ensure accurate predictions. It includes details like:  
- Date of Journey  
- Source & Destination  
- Airline  
- Number of Stops  
- Ticket Price  

## 🔍 Model Performance  
Multiple regression models were tested, including:  
- Linear Regression  
- Decision Tree Regressor  
- Random Forest Regressor  
- Gradient Boosting Regressor  
- XGBoost Regressor  

The model with the best **Adjusted R² score** was selected for final predictions.  

## 📊 Visualization  
Key insights were obtained using data visualizations, including:  
- **Days Left vs. Ticket Price:** To identify pricing trends.  
- **Actual vs. Predicted Prices:** Evaluating model accuracy.  

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. Data is preprocessed and cleaned.  
2. Multiple regression models are trained and evaluated.  
3. The best-performing model is selected for price prediction.  
4. Predictions are visualized to compare actual vs. predicted prices.
